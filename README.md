# Project-2
#Number machine

#The number machine was developed using python. The machine accept only 5 digit numbers. 
if the user enter less or more than 5 digit numbers the machine will tell the user to enter 5 digit. 
The machine will reverse the 5 digit numbers and after that will find the sum between the number before tranformation and the reverse number. 
Lastly, the machine will generate the new number by adding 1 to each number in the sum. The machine will terminate after generating new number
